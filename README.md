<b>Summary:</b> <br>
As a student in college, knowing your current standing in a class is important in determining if you should reach out for
help, drop the class, or determine what score on a particular assignment may allow you to earn a certain grade in the class.
For example, if a student has completed all assignments, labs, and projects for a class, but the final exam remains, it would
be useful for the student to know the impact a certain grade on the final exam will have on their course grade (earning them
an "A" for the class, a passing grade, or a failing grade).

The MEC Review Project aims to have students build a working grade calculator for the class (CSC 212). Using structures
learned within CSC 211, students are required to provide an algorithm that will calculate your current standing in the class
based off of what assignments/exams/projects/labs have been completed thus far.

Algorithm Features and Description:<br>
Inputs from user include: # of completed labs, assignments, exams, and projects. Then, input doubles as the scores recieved for each of the labs/assignments/exams/projects. The student's name.<br>
Output is a single .txt with all of the student's information - this includes the final calculated grade for the student, as well as the inputs the student gave for their grades.<br>
It was important to understand each step of the calculations first before tackling the exceptions. At first, we made sure the calculations were correct for the case in which the student had completed each and every graded submission. Once the group understood the process for that case, we were able to work backwords and handle the exceptions (when the student had not yet completed certain assignments, labs, exams, or projects). It was important for the group to detail the process first in pseudocode and writing so that each feature of the code was accounted for and then handled.
