Summary: <br>
As a student in college, knowing your current standing in a class is important in determining if you should reach out for
help, drop the class, or determine what score on a particular assignment may allow you to earn a certain grade in the class.
For example, if a student has completed all assignments, labs, and projects for a class, but the final exam remains, it would
be useful for the student to know the impact a certain grade on the final exam will have on their course grade (earning them
an "A" for the class, a passing grade, or a failing grade).

The MEC Review Project aims to have students build a working grade calculator for the class (CSC 212). Using structures
learned within CSC 211, students are required to provide an algorithm that will calculate your current standing in the class
based off of what assignments/exams/projects/labs have been completed thus far.
