<b>Summary:</b> <br>
As a student in college, knowing your current standing in a class is important. Being able to calculate your current grade will help you know how to proceed in the course - if you're doing well, you can feel confident about your study habits and the subject matter. If you're doing poorly, it may be wise to seek help to try and develop your understanding of the subject more. One of the reasons knowing your current standing is important is to determine how you may need to score on an upcoming assignment to receive a certain grade in the class. For example, if a student has completed all assignments, labs, and projects for a class, but the final exam remains, it would be useful for the student to know what score they needed to, say, pass the class or receieve an "A".

The MEC Review Project allows students to build a tool which allows them to calculate their current standing for a class. For this specific project, the class grade that will be calculated will be for CSC 212. Using the structures and methods introduced within CSC 211, students are required to provide an algorithm that will provide an accurate current standing based on the specific weights and assignments that are required within CSC 212.

Algorithm Features and Description:<br>
Inputs from user include: # of completed labs, assignments, exams, and projects. Then, input doubles as the scores recieved for each of the labs/assignments/exams/projects. The student's name.<br>
Output is a single .txt with all of the student's information - this includes the final calculated grade for the student, as well as the inputs the student gave for their grades.<br>
It was important to understand each step of the calculations first before tackling the exceptions. At first, we made sure the calculations were correct for the case in which the student had completed each and every graded submission. Once the group understood the process for that case, we were able to work backwords and handle the exceptions (when the student had not yet completed certain assignments, labs, exams, or projects). It was important for the group to detail the process first in pseudocode and writing so that each feature of the code was accounted for and then handled.
